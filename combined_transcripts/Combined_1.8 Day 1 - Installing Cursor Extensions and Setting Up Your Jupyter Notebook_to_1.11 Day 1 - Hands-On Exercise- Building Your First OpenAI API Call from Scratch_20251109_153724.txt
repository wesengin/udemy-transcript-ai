# 1.8 Day 1 - Installing Cursor Extensions and Setting Up Your Jupyter Notebook

Welcome to step five of the setup, the very final step.I'm here in Cursa and just before we get going in Cursa, we have to install some things called Cursaextensions.It might prompt you.It might say, do you want to install the recommended extensions?In which case just say yes because it will get them right.But but if not, then we just need to install them.If you've never done this before and very simple to do, you start by going to the view menu and youselect extensions.And this comes up over on the left where the files were.And you now need to search for Python to bring up the Python extensions, which does things like coloringin code nicely and checking it and the like.Now there are in fact two different Python extensions.One of them is made by someone called Innersphere.Well, Innersphere is actually the name of the makers of Cursa.So this is the one for for Cursa.There's another one made by Mr. Python, which happens to be the going name for Microsoft, better knownas Microsoft, and either of these will do just great.I have the Microsoft one installed.You can have the one you click on it, make sure that you install it, and then you'll have Python installed.And then back to the search and search for Jupyter.And then you'll see that there is Jupyter by this company, Miss Tools AI, better known again as Microsoft.And this has like 4 million downloads and it's great.And Jupyter, which is the name of the particular type of data science interactive work that we'll bedoing Jupyter you want to install as well.Mine's already installed, which is why it says uninstall there.And so make sure that both of those are installed.And once you've done that, finally you go back to the view menu and you go to explorer again to bringback the files on the left.You open the week one folder, the week one directory, and and click on day one dot ipynb, which standsfor IPython notebook, which is one of these kinds of things.And congratulations, you've opened the day one notebook.We're so nearly there.The very, very final step is to go to this thing here that says select kernel.The kernel is the name of the of the Python process, which is going to be running behind all of thisthat we're about to work through.So you have to press this button, select kernel.And it will pop up with this little pop up saying Python environments or existing Jupyter server.It all sounds very high tech.You choose Python environments and you should get this list.You may only have one option on your list, but you should have something where the top option shouldhave a star next to it.It should be called dot env and it should say Python 3.12. something.It might be 3.1, 2.1, 10.11.And it should have this kind of path dot venv bin python this thing and it should say recommended.And this is the one to pick and it should look beautiful.It's referring to that folder right there.You see on the left.That's what this is pointing to.Now, if this doesn't pop up as an option, then go to the troubleshooting notebook that is in the setupfolder.And that is where it will help you out.But it should do.Hopefully you should be able to select it.It's now selected and we have ourselves a Jupyter notebook that's ready to go.These things are called Jupyter notebooks.Uh, these this type of format of thing, this dot ipynb.And that is now set.If you need help, then you go to the setup folder.There is a troubleshooting ipynb.And that is where you'll get more instructions for troubleshooting.But hopefully you now have this open.You're looking at this.You have your your environment set.Your kernel is set.It's finally time to go through our first lab.So these things are sometimes called labs, sometimes called notebooks.They're like Python files which have mixtures of of text, formatted text and code.And you can run the code piece by piece.Each of the pieces are called cells.You may be if you're if you're already in data science, you know this stuff super well.Uh, but, you know, uh, I'm going to explain it to the others.Now I've used I've treat these like, like living, breathing documents with tons of good interestingmaterial.And I do ask that you spend a moment to read through them, particularly this first one, because Igive a real lay of the land here.I explain that we're about to embark on our first LLM project and look, it's a simple one, but you'vegot to start somewhere.And for the pros, you can really rattle through this really fast.But you know, we we have to do something simple later in the course.We're going to be building a complete agentic platform with multiple agents collaborating and doingall sorts of stuff with, with many different llms involved.But we're starting small.That's the way to do it.What we're going to build is something which is a different kind of web browser.It's something which is able to take a web address or URL and find a scrape it, and then make a summaryof that web page and display that summary in a nice format.It's our own little Reader's Digest of the internet.That's what we're building.And and sure, you could, you know, ChatGPT now the product has some things like this built into itthat you could ask it, but we're basically building our own.We're building a product like that ourselves, and we're going to do it using an API call to the underlyingGPT model.Okay.So I do want to point out if you're new to using these things called notebooks, they're also calledlabs, also known as Jupyter Lab.As you now know that I've got lots of guides here that will help you through this.There's I think you already know there's guides to the command line, guides to using git and GitHub.There's some technical foundations to to explain things like endpoints and APIs and environment variables.And then there is this guide all about using notebooks, which you should look at to learn more abouthow to use notebooks.And there's also some Python foundations if you're new to Python as well.Um, also, we'll talk a lot about what to do if you want to use models other than OpenAI, such asusing Gemini, which has some free tiers, or using llama with local models, there is a guide thatgoes through all that as well that you can have a preview look at, but we'll be doing it together.A reminder that I am here to help you.You know that you can reach out to me by email through the platform, and you can always connect withme on LinkedIn.I might have mentioned that something I kind of like, so feel free to do it.Uh, there's the troubleshooting notebook.That's that's right here as well that it is in the setup folder troubleshooting right there.So go to troubleshooting if you have any problems.And as I say if this is stuff you already know about then just speed me up.Put me on two x.Go go through this nice and quickly.Uh.And I'll hope to to throw in some interesting stuff as well.But we will get to more juicy stuff very soon.Now, the way that I run these labs is a bit different to some other courses you might be familiar with,and I make the point here, and I do ask you to read through this.I don't like to sit here typing while you watch.I will do that a little bit because I know people want to see that.I'll do a bit of it, but I feel like that's not a good use of either of our time, particularly ina day with AI tools as well.I prefer to show you some code to explain how it works and why it works, to run it, and for you toalso run it.Put in print statements, change it, make it your own.Investigate it.Experiment with it.That's the best way to learn.Not by sitting there typing things through.Now some people like to type and that's that's all good.Of course you can just delete the cell and then retype it, or create an empty new notebook and startfrom scratch as you wish.Everyone learns differently, but I suggest dig into the code, explore it, experiment with it, anduse this as your starting point for your own projects.So.So make your variations and then it's it's great practice.It also gives you an opportunity to make a variation and post it on LinkedIn and tag me.And that's something that I will happily weigh in and make sure that I amplify your achievement.Look at the fact that these labs will be changing all the time.I constantly update them, sometimes multiple times a week, to have the latest models to have betterexplanations as people ask questions.So please assume that these.The text here is a living, breathing document, and if what you see on the screen doesn't match exactlywhat I'm saying, don't worry about it.What you're seeing is better and I'll try.I won't subtract anything.I'll only add more good stuff.So so welcome.The fact that there could be new content that you're looking here.And finally, I do want to try and emphasize the business value of everything that we build.Whilst I'll try and make it fun and entertaining, I will also come back to talk about the commercialimpact of what we do, and there'll be commercial exercises for you at the end.All right.And then it tells you about installing the cursor extensions, which we've done.Select the kernel which we've done, and it's time now for us to get going with some code.


================================================================================


# 1.9 Day 1 - Running Your First OpenAI API Call and System vs User Prompts

Okay, so now you scroll to this first box right here which says imports.And the way that you run this bit of code known as a cell is you hold down the shift button and youpress return.While you've clicked anywhere in this box, I press this and it runs.Now, if you have any errors running this, if you get an import error or something like that, or ifit just doesn't seem to run, it just sits there.It means your kernel isn't set right.Look on the top right there.Look at what mine says.It needs to look a bit like that 3.12. something.It needs to be referring to your local venv right there.That is what you have to see.And then it should run just fine.There's no output yet.Nothing's happened.It should run.It should show a tick mark, meaning that it's run.You've just done some imports.We'll talk more about what all of this does later, but for now, just run that code.Okay.The next thing we're going to do.So come down to this next block of code right here is we are going to load in that dot EMV file, thatsecret file with our environment variables, our secrets.We're going to load it in.And we're then going to collect this thing called OpenAI underscore API underscore key.And as long as you set it right then it's going to find a key and it's going to be happy.Let me see I hold down shift I hit enter and it says API key found and looks good so far.Now if yours doesn't say that then something's wrong with your EMV file and it's going to give someexplanation.Hopefully.Maybe it doesn't start with the right thing.Maybe you forgot to save your env file.Something went wrong.You can go to the troubleshooting lab to dig into it, or you can have a look yourself and try and figureout why it wasn't able to read in your EMV file, but I'm hoping it did.You're in great shape.You found an API key.All is good.Let's make our first call to OpenAI running in the cloud.Now we're going to call OpenAI in the cloud.And if you don't want to, if you want to use Olama, then wait for tomorrow in day two.We're going to redo this using Olama running locally, so that will be your day.So never fear, it will happen.But for now, what we're going to do here is we are going to, uh, to send this message to OpenAI toGPT two.We're actually going to use GPT five, the new version of GPT.And what are we going to do?We're going to say, hello, GPT.This is my first ever message to you.Hi.Uh, so I've put that in this variable message.Now, the first thing I have to do is I have to put that into another variable called messages, whichis in a special format that OpenAI expects.And you'll see that cursor already fills in what it knows I'm going to do, but I'm going to ignorecursor.I'm going to type it because I know some people like me to type, so I'm going to type.So what you send to OpenAI, the format is a particular format that OpenAI came up with, and we'regoing to talk so much more about this format.So I don't want you to worry about it right now.I'm just going to tell you that it is a Python list and the Python list contains a number of dictionaries.Python dictionaries.In this case, we're only going to have one dictionary.There it is.So it's a list with one dictionary in it.And that dictionary is going to have two keys.One key is called role.And the other key is going to be called content.And that role we're going to put in that in for the key role.We're going to have the value being the word user.And we'll find out why later.And there's going to be another field, another field with key content.And what we're going to put in there is going to be that message.Hello GPT, this is my first ever message to you.Okay, that's all clear.Let's just print what that see what that looks like.It looks like uh, list with one dictionary in it with role user content.Hello, GPT, this is my first ever message to you.Hi.Okay.That's easy.Next up, I'm going to hover down here like this.And I'm going to add in.So I just hit another code block by pressing code right there okay.Now I'm going to type in, um, OpenAI equals open a equals open AI like that.I'm creating a new instance of an object, OpenAI.And again we will cover exactly what that's doing another time.And now I'm going to make my first API call to GPT running on the cloud.And this is how I do it I type response equals OpenAI dot chat dot completions dot create.And that might sound like it's nonsense to you.You will get so used to that that you're going to dream it eventually.But for now, just believe me, that's what we type.It's known as the Chat Completions API.And you say OpenAI completions create.We pass in the name of a model.And the name we're going to go with is GPT five Dash nano, a very cheap version of the latest model,GPT five.At least the latest for me right now.And then the messages I'm going to pass in is going to be this variable messages that we just created.And that is it that is going to call GPT.And with what comes back, what we want to take is we want to take this response and we want to takethe choices variable there.We want to take the first choice message content.There it is.That's what we're going to do.I'm going to now press shift and enter.And when I do that it's actually going to call out to to GPT running in the cloud.Let's do it.Let's see what happens.It takes a little bit of time for for that.And it says, hi there.Nice to meet you and welcome.Thanks for saying hi.I'm here to help with questions, explanations, writing, brainstorming, planning, learning and more.Encoding.What would you like to do today?If you're not sure, here are a few quick ideas.And on it goes.So, a very verbose answer for our very first call to GPT running in the cloud.And it was all pretty easy.And we were running it from code.And if you know all this already, then good for you.Zoom through it.If this is completely new to you, then we're going to talk a lot more about this.It's going to all make absolute sense very soon.But I want you to enjoy your first call to an LLM.Okay.So I have written a little function that is called fetch website contents.And that little function is right here in scraper pi.Now this is what it looks like.This is not a course about web scraping.So I don't plan to tell you about what I've done here.I'm using a lovely package called Beautifulsoup that's very popular.You can look at this function if you wish and use it yourself.But it's very, very simple.And it's doing just what's known as a server side scrape that it just collects that web page.It's not actually rendering this web page.So it's not a very sophisticated web scrape, but it fetches the contents of this URL.So that's what we're using here.And for example, I could pass in my own personal web page https.Com and I could use fetch website contents and see what I get there and what I get if I run.This is a whole lot of stuff from my website.And if I actually if I say like print ad, then we'll get something a little bit more than that.And here it is.This is the contents of my web page with lots of stuff.And it's worth noting that nothing to do with AI at this point.This web scrape is just a simple fetch of a web page.That's it.But now we're going to start to involve AI in this.So I imagine most of you know this already, but some of you might not that there are these two differentkinds of message that you send to an AI, to an LLM, two different kinds of prompt.One is called the system prompt and one is called the user prompt.And the system prompt is where you specify the frame, the overall task they're carrying out.You tell them what tone they should take.You give them context.We'll find out later.When we talk about things like Rag that you can supply information in the system prompt, it's yourway of setting the scene.The user prompt is the actual message coming from an end user to the LM that it should respond to inthe context of whatever you told it in the system prompt.So that's the difference between the system prompt and the user prompt.And people that are very familiar with this can can add all sorts of stuff to that.But but we will get there in good time.So for example, we could have a system prompt that says you are an assistant that analyzes the contentsof a website and provides a short summary, ignoring texts that might be navigation related respondin markdown.It's framing the situation, it's setting the task.It's giving the format, the style of how response should come.That is our system prompt.And we're going to to also define the start of our user prompt, which is.Here are the contents of a website.Provide a short summary in markdown if it includes news or announcements, then summarize these two.That is our user prompt prefix.So far so good okay, so we saw a second ago that when we're sending a message to OpenAI, we do itusing this list of dictionaries.And I showed you one in particular which had role user content.And then we had something like hi GPT.So there's another type of dictionary where you say role not user but system.And in fact this is how you specify the system prompt and the user prompt.Uh, you have a list of dictionaries and we'll have two dictionaries in one dictionary the role is system.And the content will then be the system message.In the second dictionary, the role is user and the content is the user message, the user prompt.And so just just to give you a silly example, here's one.Here's messages role is system content.Let's say not.You're a snarky assistant.Let's say you're a helpful assistant.And then what is two plus two.So this would be messages.And what we can do is then we can say here response is open AI.Look at how cursor fills it in for me.Look at that response is open chat completions dot create model will go with GPT 4.1.Mini know we'll make it 4.1 nano make it a really cheap, simple model.GPT 4.1 is faster than GPT five.It'll be very, very quick.And we pass in this these messages, this this list of two.So let's see what a helpful assistant has to say about this.The helpful assistant.When given this question uh, we need to print the results.Cursor didn't fill that in response.Dot choices zero dot message content.Try it again.Two plus two equals four.So now we're going to change the system message.So it doesn't say you're a helpful assistant.It says you are a snarky assistant.And otherwise exactly the same user message.What is two plus two.We run this.And oh finally a math question.Two plus two equals four.Groundbreaking.I know that's just the effect of putting in snarky there.And now a quick challenge for you in the spirit of of changing things and tweaking the code.Make a different system prompt here.Not a snarky assistant, but something else.Maybe an assistant that speaks like a cowboy, or like a pirate, or an assistant that speaks in pigLatin or in another language.Whatever you want, put it in there.Experiment.Try changing the system prompt several times and get to see how different system prompts with the sameuser prompt will change the tone, character, and mission assigned to the LM.


================================================================================


# 1.10 Day 1 - Building a Website Summarizer with OpenAI Chat Completions API

Okay, it's finally time to put this all together.So before we created our messages, just by setting a variable messages and building that list of dictionaries,what we can also do is write ourselves a little function.This is a function called messages for, and it takes in the contents of a website and it will returnour list of dictionaries.It's going to return two dictionaries.The first of them is role system content.Is the system prompt that we defined up there somewhere.The second one is role user and the content is the user prompt prefix, followed by this website that'spassed in.Okay, that sounds good.Remember the prefix looks up there.Maybe we should put in an extra empty line there.That's probably a good idea.Uh, so that that website will then get get shoved in underneath.All right, let's run this.We've just defined a function that will return this list of dictionaries when we pass in a website.So we have a website.We have one in the variable AD.It contains all of my personal web page.So if I run this cell, we'll see what we get.We get something which is indeed a list of dictionaries.There's one dictionary that's that's got role system content, and it's your assistant analyzes contentsof a website and then role user.Here are the contents of a website.And if I scroll you will see that it's got the full contents of my website.So hopefully this is super simple.We've we've written a function.It can manufacture this list of dictionaries.The list of dictionaries contains a system prompt and a user prompt.The system prompt is telling it.You summarize websites.The user prompt says, hey, here's a website to summarize, and then it has the contents of the website.Okay?And now it's time to bring it together in this lovely function right here.Okay.And just before we run this summarize function, I want to mention I did just make a little tweak tothe system prompt I added in this sentence do not wrap the markdown in a code block.And this is a little trick that you sometimes see that prevents it from putting extra stuff around theresponse.Not super important, but makes the results a bit better.Okay, so this here this summarize.This is the function that brings it all together.We start it takes a URL, a URL like madonna.com.It starts by calling fetch.Website contents that you'll remember is my utility that goes off and pulls a website's contents.We put that in a variable website.We then call OpenAI.Create.That is the chat completions API.That is new to you now, but you will soon know that off by heart you will.You will dream it.You will know it so well.It takes two things.It takes a model.And we'll be using GPT 4.1 mini.And it takes messages, which needs to be the list of dictionaries.Well, we can get that by calling our function messages for for our website that function just here.It returns the list of dictionaries exactly what we want, and with whatever comes back, we call choiceszero content.Let's run that function.It's now been defined and let's give it a try.Let's call it for my website and see what comes back.This is now making the system and user message, putting in a dictionary and dictionaries in a list,sending it to GPT.And before I can finish explaining it, it's come back.We've got an answer.Here is a summary of my website.Our little snapshot of my website about me.It's a bit hard to see because it's all on one line and it's not so formatted, and we can fix thatquickly by making another function called Display Summary.It will call that that function.Here it will call summarize with the given URL.And then it will use this utility display markdown which is a nice way to show markdown elegantly insideone of these labs.So if I run this, then once again it's building the system message, the user message, packaging themup, calling the chat completions API.And with what comes back, I have to actually run display summary for my website.Now it's actually doing that, making a system prompt and user message, sending it off.And what comes back bam is this website summary.Uh, this website is the personal and professional homepage of Edward Donner, a coder and AI enthusiastwho enjoys experimenting with large language models.That sounds like me.Uh, and, uh, it says Nebula, and it's got some projects.It's about my interests and some posts and announcements summarized and how to reach me.Uh, so we've just done it.We've just built something that's able to take a website, scrape it and summarize it, using a callto OpenAI running in the cloud, connected to the API key in your EMV file.Congratulations.Try it with some different websites, experiment with it and hey, you can go to the system prompt andmess with that.How about we get a snarky version of the website instead of the normal version?Any of these things are possible.Go and experiment and explore and have fun.Calling the OpenAI API.Well, let's have some fun!Since I mentioned we can change the system prompt, let's go and do that.Let's go back up to the system prompt here instead of your your helpful assistant.Let's make this.You are a snarky assistant that analyzes the contents of a website and provides a short, snarky, humoroussummary.And then run that.Let's redefine the system prompt.Let's just go straight back down and rerun this line here.To summarize.Edward Donald, let's do the display version, make it the pretty version of it, run that and run displaysummary and see what we get.Edward Donner's nerdy Playground editor is your friendly neighborhood code monkey who's obsessed withplaying DJ badly.Stalking Hacker News like it's the only social interaction he needs.Latest news like you're dying to know so wonderfully.Just with that tiny change, we've been able to get a snarky version.Not just a Reader's Digest version, but a snarky version.And we can also use this to do different kinds of tones and styles and try it with other websites,too.And so I'll keep it on snarky mode.And let's look at what CNN's news of the day is.Uh, it's now collecting all of CNN's website, the news site, and it's coming, uh, the CNN, theglorious smorgasbord of everything news.Welcome to CNN, where you can get your daily dose of global chaos, celebrity heartache breaks andgovernment shenanigans in one place, trying to escape world wars, hurricanes and political drama.Too bad it's all here, front and center.Ha!So, uh, yeah, because nothing says fun like a political stalemate so wonderfully.This has given us a summary of the news, but also a snarky version of it as well.And you can try some different websites here too.What you'll discover is that this is a pretty simplistic solution.The way that I'm scraping web pages will only work for web pages that don't get rendered in the clientweb web pages, that you can just fetch them remotely and you'll get the full content.And that doesn't work for too many websites.But luckily, there's an easy way to build this out yourself if you know about this.If you know about tools like Selenium or Playwright, then you can build this yourself.And many students have.And that brings me to the topic of the community contributions.So over here in week one is a folder called Community Contributions.And it's a place where you can put your own projects.And if I open this up, you'll see that a lot of people have come and done this, which is such a joy.You can come in here and add in your own exercises and your own examples.It could be as simple as changing the system prompt to translate a web page to French or Spanish.Uh, hopefully better than any of my Spanish.Uh, and you can do anything that you want.But use this as an opportunity to make changes and to share them with other students.And there are instructions on how you do that.In the guides.There's a guide on the git and GitHub guide includes instructions for how you submit what's called aPR, a pull request, which lets me merge in your changes into the repo.And I would love that.And I'd love it if you shared it.And it's a great way to add value to the whole community and to get your work seen and get get me tosee it and look at it and comment on it as well.So, uh, I want to mention that that there are so many business applications of what we've built,uh, the fact that we've, we've just experienced calling a frontier model in the cloud, and we'vethen given it some instructions to summarize it, to change the tone, we could translate it.There are so many different ways that you could extend this and use it, and you will see many of themin community contributions.So many things.Someone added it to to to call the Yahoo Finance API to summarize stock movements.There's lots of other stuff in here and you should be inspired by this, but try and take it in yourown direction.Apply it to your business or to some some personal thing that's been on your mind.A pain point that you think you can fix.A simple way that you can make a call that involves collecting a web page and doing something with thatweb page.That's it's such an open canvas.There's so many different commercial directions that you can take this, this idea of summarizationor translation.This is one of the most essential and simple gen AI use cases, and you now know how to do it.And you can apply this to any problem you want.So please do that, apply it to a different business and try it out for yourself.Uh, try making something and and have fun with it above all.


================================================================================


# 1.11 Day 1 - Hands-On Exercise- Building Your First OpenAI API Call from Scratch

And now an exercise for you.You've just hopefully gone in and run this for other web pages, and you've maybe tried tweaking itfor a different business purpose.The exercise is now to come in here and see if you can make your own message to GPT from scratch.So first of all, write a simple system prompt.Now you should think about something completely different to do here, perhaps still related to to summarizinginformation.So as an example, you might want to summarize the contents of an email.Or perhaps you might want to take an email and come up with a nice subject, a possible subject forthat email that might be an example of a business task.So in the system prompt here, describe the task that you want it to do in the user prompt.You'll want to put in here the contents of the email or the thing to be translated or whatever the isgoing to be the prompt with the instruction.Then you now have to do some typing, just like I did some typing.It's your turn to do some typing.Replace this messages equals you're going to want to put in here something which will describe yourmessages to OpenAI.So this is going to be a place where you're going to put in a list of dictionaries, two dictionaries.And it's going to have some things in it like role and content, and cursor is determined to fill itin for me.But don't cheat.Uh, try and see if you can't do it yourself and then cheat if you can't.Of course, it's always good to use AI tools.It's not cheating in the least.And then you have to uncomment this line and have response equals and type in the the the command thatyou're going to give, which I'll tell you very quickly, is OpenAI create.And you pass in the model name and the messages, and then you're going to print the result.And the result will be this word response .0. content.And always look back up in this code and copy and paste to get that example.And when you've done that you should find that that works.And if you've built something like something that can give you the subject of an email or somethingelse, then please consider doing a PR.The instructions are in the in the guide so that I can get to see it myself.And I can share in your joy of your first commercial call to an LLM.And then finally, there's this extra exercise I mentioned for people that are pros, people that alreadyknow this stuff.You'll be aware that, as I say, my my way of web scraping is super simplistic, but you could useselenium or playwright or something similar to do proper web scraping with a web page that gets renderedin the browser, and you'll see that other people have done that.There's a playwright version there.I know that there's several selenium versions.You could look at how other students have done it.But first, if you know this stuff, if you've used selenium or playwright before, have a shot at doingit yourself as well to build a more industrial strength.Web page summarizer.And then afterwards, as I say one more time, please do consider sharing your code.The guide will tell you how to do it.Submit a PR.I will gladly review it and I'd love to include it in the community contributions with 1 or 2 otherpeople that have done this too.Okay, so with that, that's your mission.Enjoy it.Fill this in.If if you if you find that you're struggling with it, please don't worry.We're going to be doing this so many times over the next eight weeks that's going to become second nature.Give it a shot.Give it your best crack.And if you can't get it this time, don't worry.We'll be coming back to this tomorrow.Wow.You're probably thinking, whoa, this if this is if this day is what every day is like, this courseis going to go on forever.No, today was a big, big day.And it's longer than most of our days will be.You've got through a ton of material.You've made your first request to an LLM, and I'm hoping that you've also adapted it for a differentcommercial task.And maybe you've even submitted a PR.So much has got done and and it's just just a great start.Your environment is built and ready for prime time.And tomorrow we're going to start getting a little bit deeper.But already, even though your journey just started, your 2.5% of the way along your journey to theto the path of being 100% a master of LM engineering.You've already used a llama to run a model locally on your box.Perhaps several models.Seems like an age ago that we did that.But we did that.You've written code that calls OpenAI's frontier models.You know the difference between a system prompt and a user prompt.And you've built summarization.You know how to apply to commercial problems.Maybe you've built a couple yourself.Tomorrow is going to be a little bit of a breather.It's going to be an easier day, I promise.We're going to talk about the steps it takes between now and being a master of LM engineering.I'm going to set you up for success.We're going to talk through some of the top frontier models out there, and we'll also do a little bitof a dig into Olama and using Olama locally.I kind of repeat of that lab, but using Olama locally on on our own computers, people that didn'twant to to get OpenAI.That's your chance to use Olama instead.So I'm super excited to see you on day two.You survived all of day one that by far the biggest day of the whole course.So tomorrow much gentler.Can't wait.See you then.
